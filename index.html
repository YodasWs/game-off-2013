<p>Welcome to Brython, a land of simple farmers. The Romans call this land Britannia like they own it, but they leave us
alone as long we leave them alone. A nice thing about a large protective force is that our land has been at peace for more
than three centuries. But the world is changing. More and more Roman legionaries are redeploying to their troubled
provinces in the east. Trade with the rest of the empire is becoming more and more sporadic as civil wars ravage throughout
the empire in the name of one general or another. Barbarians from the north and across the seas are raiding the
countryside.</p>
<p>So, Welcome to Brython. Can you lead the people through these turbulent times?</p>
