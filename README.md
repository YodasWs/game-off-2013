## Intro

Welcome to Armitonia, the greatest empire the world has ever known. For a thousand years Armitonia has withstood disasters,
plagues, invasions, and cat overpopulation. But the world is always changing. There is an emerging world power threatening our
place as sole world leader. At home, our once glorious economy is faultering due to corruption and external forces. The people
grow weary of failed policies and are losing faith. This great nation needs a new leader who can unite the people and restore
our rightful place in the world. Can you lead our nation through these troubled times?
